PokeHeist Visual - IGN Code Foo 9

I decided to built out a little front end display for the pokemon programming question. Full disclosure I built it based off an example from the 'react-spring' library. I've just started using it and really enjoy the animations, but this does run into some performance issues the deeper the components are nested.

##Getting Started

Clone this repository to your machine.

To view on your local host, use yarn install or npm install to install dependencies.

then cd into your folder and "yarn start!"

To deploy to heroku make run the "heroku create"
Make sure your commits are up to date
then run "git push heroku master"
followed by "heroku open".

This should work, if there's an issue,
try again using the command "heroku create -b https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack.git" in place of "heroku create".


##Quick Answer

Assuming Jesse is about 5'8 based on Brock's cannon height of 5'0, and the radius of the net when in a sphere is about the height of Jesse, we can estimate with A=4πr^2 that the area inside the net is about 2.06×10^5in^3. According to bulbapedia, the size of a Poké Ball when in storage mode is the size of a ping pong ball (capture mode is baseball sized). The radius of a pingpong ball is about 0.79inches, so the average area is 7.84in^3. 2.06x10^5/7.84 = 26,275 when rounded down, meaning the most Poké Balls team rocket could escape with is 26,275.
