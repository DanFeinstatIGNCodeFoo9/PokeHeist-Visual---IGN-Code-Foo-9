PokeHeist Visual - IGN Code Foo 9

I decided to built out a little front end display for the pokemon programming question. Full disclosure I built it based off an example from the 'react-spring' library. I've just started using it and really enjoy the animations, but this does run into some performance issues the deeper the components are nested.

##Getting Started

then cd into your folder and "yarn start!"

To deploy to heroku make run the "heroku create"
Make sure your commits are up to date
then run "git push heroku master"
followed by "heroku open".

This should work, if there's an issue,
try again using the command "heroku create -b https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack.git" in place of "heroku create".
